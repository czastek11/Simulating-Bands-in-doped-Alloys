# Simulating-Bands-in-doped-Alloys
This program calculates first conduction and holes bands for binary,trinary and quadrary doped alloys.
projekt_fianl.cpp is just a example in usage of program, it follows exercises from course final project, which are described in comments.
Alloy.cpp and Alloy.h define all functions and classes. One can test with it any semiconductor with known material constans and with any doping level.
Most of formulas and all constants used in example file were from Vurgaftman, I., Meyer, J. R., & Ram-Mohan, L. R. (2001). Band parameters for III–V compound semiconductors and their alloys. Journal of Applied Physics, 89(11), 5815–5875.
